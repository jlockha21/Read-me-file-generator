## Description
AS A developer who needs to create multiple README files, I WANT to be able to plug in information, SO THAT the application can generate a README file depending on the application.

## Installation
The user will need to download the file from the repository. Then, in the file directory in the command line, run `npm start` to start the application.

## Usage
After the application has been launched, the command line will prompt a series of questions for the user, so that the information can be input into a README file, neatly organized for the user to add to their folder of code.
